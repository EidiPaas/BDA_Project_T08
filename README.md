This project focuses on analyzing Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and churn probability using machine learning models, with additional insights generated from uplift modeling. The objective was to identify high-value customers with high churn risk and suggest targeted interventions.

## Key Insights

Gender-specific insights show clear differences in transaction behavior.

Uplift modeling revealed which customer segments respond best to marketing treatments.

## Conclusions
Gender-specific marketing strategies may enhance response rates.

Prioritize high CLV + high churn customers to prevent major revenue loss.

Re-engaging Dormant customers can offer significant ROI.
